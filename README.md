# Vape

A flexible headless CMS based on Vapor (Swift server-side web framework)!

## About
### What's this?
As the name suggest, this is yet another *flexible* headless CMS, this time written in Swift using Vapor.

### Why should I use Vape?
Not sure. You probably don't need to. This is a side project that I'm writing in my free time in between work. The purpose of this project is for me to explore *Vapor server-side web framework* and hopefully, someone else will join and learn together.

### What's the purpose of Vape?
I want to write a blog. Want to learn writing my own frontend and backend. *Nuff said*.

### If it's for personal purpose, why the hell do you open source it?
**Because why not?**
On serious note, I hope someone will look at my code and bash about how *shitty* it is, so I can learn to be a better programmer. I'm also open to other people contributing to this project or maybe fork it and use it for their own purpose.

### Why is it called Vape?
Because *vaping* creates *vapor*.

## To Do
Obviously, this project is useless at this point, so here's the plan:
1. Implement a simple way to create a new table with and its values.
2. Ability to display the table content in JSON format.
3. This is useless, I'll probably go away from this plan and ended up modifying on the way.

## Contribution
Wait, why?
Okay, if you do want to contribute for whatever reason (*which honestly I'll probably gonna be really happy, yeay!*) do **post an issue first**.
